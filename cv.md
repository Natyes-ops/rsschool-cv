## About me

✅10+ completed projects and 1500+ hours in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript

📌 My journey in front-end development began in 2020 in college. Back then, as a student, I just wanted to create something new, useful, helping people.

Beginning in lectures, I got acquainted with frontend technologies (HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Less, JS, etc.). After that, I watched videos on Youtube and improved my competence in website development.

During my studies, I managed to work in a web studio (you can see the work in the portfolio), where I studied Wordpress and Opencart in more detail. Now I continue to study various technologies on the Internet.

"Two years have passed, my skills have only improved, and I have 2 of my projects developed in a web studio, and more than 10 freelancing projects that you can see in my portfolio.
